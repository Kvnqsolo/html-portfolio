    <h1>Best Animes According To Kvnqsolo</h1>
    <h2>my top 3 Animes of All-time</h2> <hr>

    <h2>One Piece</h2>
    <p>     
       One Piece was only supposed to last for five years. As we've just mentioned, One Piece began 25 years ago, way before you were born! ... </br>
       Sanji was originally named Naruto. ... </br>
       Zoro was originally part of the Buggy Pirates. ... </br>
       Katakuri could break a doughnut world record. ... </br>
       One Piece was originally called Romance Dawn. </br>
    </p>

    <h2>Naruto</h2>
    <p>     
        Not only does Naruto explore the heavy but intriguing me of cycles of violence, but it also offers an inspiring solution. Naruto Uzumaki inherited Jiraiya's dream of ending the world's cycles of hatred forever and that's what inspired Naruto to take the fight to Pain and end the fighting for good.
